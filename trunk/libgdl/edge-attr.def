  /* anchor: Int, no default value
     An anchor point describes the vertical position in a node where an edge
     starts. This is useful if node labels are several lines long and outgoing
     edges are related to label lines. (For instance, this allows a nice
     visualization of structs containing pointers as fields). A node with
     anchored edges can only have one near edge at maximum. Further, if
     anchored edges occur, the graph orientation is always top_to_bottom. */
     
     
  /* arrowcolor: Color Entry, default is the value of color
     backarrowcolor: Color Entry, default is the value of color
     Specify the color of the arrow head or back arrow head respectively. For
     the avilable Color Entries, see section Colors. */
     
     
  /* arrowsize: Int, default is 10
     backarrowsize: Int, default is 0
     Specify the length of the cathetuses of the arrow head or back arrow head
     respectively, the arrow head being a right-angled, isosceles triangle. */
     
  /* class: Int, default is 1
     Specifies the edge class to which an edge belongs. For details, see
     Expose/hide edges. See also graph attribute classname. */
     
  /* color: Color Entry, default is black
     Specifies the color of an edge. For the available Color Entries, see
     section Colors. See also edge attributes textcolor and arrowcolor. */
     
  /* fontname: "Font File", as of aiSee 2.1.88,
     default is the default vector font drawn by turtle graphics routines
     Specifies a pixel font to be used for drawing the edge labels. This font
     is given by the name of the aiSee Font File containing the font
     description, e.g. a 12-point Helvetica Bold font can be specified via
     fontname: "helvB12". Note: If the font file is not in the current
     directory the environment variable AISEEFONTS has to be set to the
     directory containing the font description files. For the available Font
     Files, see additional fonts. */
     
  /* horizontal_order: Int, default is -1 (i.e. no default)
     In a hierarchical layout, this attribute specifies the horizontal position
     of long edges. This is only of interest if an edge crosses several levels
     (see node attribute horizontal_order). This attribute specifies the point
     where the edge crosses the level.
     
     The nodes specified by horizontal positions are ordered according to these
     positions within a level. The horizontal position of a long edge crossing
     a level specifies the two nodes of the level between which the edge has to
     be drawn. Other edges not possessing this attribute are inserted in this
     ordering by the crossing reduction mechanism (see crossing reduction). */
     
  /* label: "String", default is "" (empty string)
     Specifies the text label of an edge. It is drawn if the graph attribute
     display_edge_labels is set to yes. The label string may contain control
     characters, e.g. \n (newline character), that influence the size of the
     label, font color or style. See character set for more details. */

  /* linestyle: Style, default is solid
     Specifies the style in which an edge is drawn. The following Styles are
     available:
     
         * solid
           The edge is drawn as a solid line
         * continuous
           Same as solid
         * invisible
           The edge is not drawn and attributes such as color and thickness are
     ignored
         * dashed
           The edge consists of single dashes
         * dotted
           The edge consists of single dots
         * double
           The edge consists of a solid double line
         * triple
           The edge consists of a solid triple line */

  /* priority: Int, default is 1
     Depending on the layout algorithm selected, the positions of the nodes may
     be mainly determined by the incoming and outgoing edges. In such case, the
     edges can be imagined as rubberbands pulling a node to its position. The
     priority of an edge corresponds to the strength of the imaginary
     rubberband. */

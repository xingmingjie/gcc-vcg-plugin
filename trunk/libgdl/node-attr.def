  /* bordercolor: Color Entry,
  default is the value of the textcolor attribute for nodes
  Specifies the color for node borders. For the available Color Entries, see
  section Colors. See also node attributes color and textcolor.
  
  borderstyle: Style, default is solid
  Specifies the line style used for drawing the borders of a node. The
  following Styles are available:
  
      * solid
      * continuous
      * dashed
      * dotted
      * double
      * triple */

DEF_ATTR (bordercolor, "bordercolor", const char *, GDL_CODE_STR, "")

  /* borderwidth: Int, default is 2
  Specifies the width of the border of a node in pixels. */

DEF_ATTR (borderwidth, "borderwidth", int, GDL_CODE_INT, 2)

  /* color: Color Entry,
  default is white
  Specifies the background color of a node. For the available Color Entries,
  see section Colors. See also node attributes textcolor and bordercolor. */

DEF_ATTR (color, "color", const char *, GDL_CODE_STR, "white")

  /* focus, no value, no default value
  Sets the focus for the node for which it is specified. After startup this
  node is centered in the graph window. The focus can also be specified for
  summary nodes. It goes without saying that the focus attribute should appear
  only once in a graph specification. */
  
  /* fontname: "Font File",
  default is the default vector font drawn by turtle graphics routines
  Specifies a pixel font different from the default vector font and used for
  drawing the node labels. This font is given by the name of the aiSee Font
  File containing the font description, e.g. a 12-point Helvetica Bold font
  can be specified via fontname: "helvB12". Note: If the font file is not in
  the current directory the environment variable AISEEFONTS has to be set to
  the directory containing the font description files. For the available Font
  Files, see additional fonts. */
  
  /* height: Int
  default is (node label height) pixels
  specifies the height of a node including the border. See also width. */

  /* horizontal_order: Int, default is -1 (i.e. no default)
  In a hierarchical layout, this attribute specifies the horizontal position
  of a node within a level (see vertical_order). Nodes specified by horizontal
  positions are ordered according to these positions within levels. Nodes
  without this attribute are inserted into this ordering by the crossing
  reduction mechanism (see crossing reduction).
  
  Note: Connected components are handled separately during crossing reduction,
  thus it is not possible to intermix nodes of different connected components
  in one ordering sequence. For example, one connected component consists of
  nodes A, B, C and another of nodes D, E, all nodes being positioned at the
  same level. Then, for instance, it is not possible to specify the following
  horizontal order at level 0: A, D, C, E.
  Note further: If the algorithm for downward laid-out trees is used the
  specified horizontal order is retained only within nodes that are children
  of the same node, i.e. in case of downward laid-out trees it is not possible
  to specify a horizontal order for the entire level. */
  
  /* iconfile: "File",
  no default value
  Specifies the bitmap file (in PNG, PBM, PPM, or raw PPM format) to be
  displayed in the node. If the bitmap file to be displayed is not in the
  current directory the environment variable AISEEICONS can be set to the
  directory containing the bitmap file. For details, see icons. */
  
  /* importance: Int, default is 0 (which actually means infinity)
  This is the central attribute when it comes to filtering in fish-eye views
  as it enables the importance of a node to be specified via an integer. Low
  integers signify less important nodes which are filtered out first by a
  filtering fish-eye view. High integer numbers signify nodes that are
  important, their being rarely filtered out. A value of 0 represents an
  infinite importance, the result being that these nodes are never filtered
  out. This attribute also exists for summary nodes of folded subgraphs, see
  importance. */
  
  /* info1: "String", default is "" (empty string)
  info2: "String", default is "" (empty string)
  info3: "String", default is "" (empty string)
  Enable three additional text fields to be specified for a node. The same set
  of attributes exists for subgraphs/summary nodes (see graph attribute
  info1). These additional information fields can be selected interactively
  from the Information submenu.
  
  When exporting graphs to SVG format, a URL can be specified in the info3
  field of a node that is visited when the user clicks on that node in the SVG
  image. The URL specification has to be in the format info3: "href:URL",
  meaning that if the content of an info3 field does not start with href:, it
  will be interpreted as a normal information field rather than as a
  hyperlink. See example.
  
  aiSee supports the following optional hyperlink attributes:
  
      * target
      * onMouseOver
      * onMouseOut
      * onClick
      * onMouseMove as of aiSee 2.1.96
      * onMouseDown as of aiSee 2.1.96
      * onMouseUp as of aiSee 2.1.96
  
  These attributes can be specified in any order after the URL specification
  in the info3 field of a node (as of aiSee 2.1.96, the URL specification is
  optional). The specifications must be separated by semicolons. Examples:
  
  info3: "href:http://www.aisee.com/svg/"
  info3: "href:javascript:blabla(42,'Hello world!')"
  info3: "href:http://www.absint.com;
          target:_blank; onClick:foo('bar')"
  info3: "href:#;
          onMouseOver:showInfo('humpty dumpty');
          onMouseOut:showInfo('')"
  // as of aiSee 2.1.96:
  info3: "onMouseOver:showInfo('humpty dumpty');
          onMouseOut:showInfo('')"
  info3: "onMouseDown:foo(1);onMouseUp:bar(2)"
  
  If the URL and/or the values of the hyperlink attributes themselves contain
  semicolons, they must be escaped by using the special character \fi059
  instead. If the URL contains ampersands, they may not be escaped. aiSee will
  automatically convert them to &amp; when exporting the graph to SVG.
  Examples:
  
  GDL specification
  	
  
  SVG output
  ... example.asp?a=b&x=y ... 	... example.asp?a=b&amp;x=y ...
  ... example.asp?a=b&amp;x=y ... 	... example.asp?a=b&amp;amp;x=y ...
  ... example.asp?a=b\fi059x=y ... 	... example.asp?a=b;x=y ...
  ... example.asp?a=b;x=y ... 	... example.asp?a=b
  
  If aiSee spots a mouse event handler specification in the GDL source of a
  graph, it automatically includes a reference to an external JavaScript file
  when exporting the graph to SVG:
  
  <svg:script xlink:href="SVGFileName.js" language="JavaScript">
  </svg:script>
  
  This allows JavaScript functions and global variables to be conveniently
  specified in the external JS file rather than in the SVG file itself. Thanks
  to this approach, you can easily make changes to your graphs and re-export
  them to SVG without having to copy & paste JavaScript code from old SVG
  files into new ones each time.
  
  See our SVG gallery for example graphs. */
  
  /* invisible: yes or no, as of aiSee 2.1.94,
  default is no
  yes forces a node to be hidden after the layout calculation. This attribute
  becomes useful when specifying dummy nodes. */
  
  /* label: "String", default is "" (empty string)
  Specifies the text to be displayed inside the node. This text may contain
  control characters, e.g. \n (newline character), that influence the size of
  the node. See character set for more details. If no label is specified, the
  value of the node attribute title is used. */

DEF_ATTR (label, "label", const char *, GDL_CODE_STR_QUOTE, "")

  /* level: Int, default is -1 (i.e. no default)
  This is a synonym for vertical_order. */
  
  /* loc: { x: Int y: Int }, no default value
  Specifies the location of a node, i.e. the x and y coordinates in relation
  to the coordinate system of the graph. The origin is in the upper left
  corner. For example, the specification loc:{x:100 y:200} places a node at
  location (100, 200) in the coordinate system.
  
  The location specification is not valid unless locations are specified for
  all nodes, otherwise aiSee calculates appropriate x and y coordinates
  according to the layout algorithm chosen. */
  
  /* margin: Int, as of aiSee 2.1.89,
  default is 3 if the value of borderwidth is > 0,
  0 if the value of borderwidth is 0
  Specifies the horizontal and vertical offset between the border of a node
  and its label in pixels. Useful for rectangular nodes only. */
  
  /* scaling: Float, default is 1.0
  Specifies the scaling factor of a node. This attribute is normally used to
  change the node text size. See also shrink / stretch. */
  
  /* shape: Shape, default is box
  Specifies the Shape of a node. The following Shapes are available:
  
      * box
      * triangle
      * circle
      * ellipse
      * rhomb
      * hexagon
      * trapeze
      * uptrapeze
      * lparallelogram
      * rparallelogram
  
  Please note that drawing ellipses is slower than drawing other shapes. */

DEF_ATTR (shape, "shape", const char *, GDL_CODE_STR, "box")

  /* shrink: Int, default is 1
  stretch: Int, default is 1
  Specify the shrinking and stretching factor of a node. The values of the
  node attributes width, height, borderwidth and the size of the label is
  scaled by ((stretch / shrink) * 100) percent. The scale value can also be
  specified by the node attribute scaling.
  
  The actual scaling factor of a node is determined by the scale factor of a
  node in relation to the scale factor of the graph, i.e. if the scaling
  factors are 2.0 for the graph and 1.5 for the node, the node is scaled by a
  factor of 3.0 as compared to normal size. */

  /* textcolor: Color Entry, default is black
  Specifies the color for text labels of nodes. If no bordercolor is
  specified, then this attribute also specifies the color for node border. For
  the available Color Entries, see section Colors. See also node attribute
  color. */

  /* textmode: center, or left_justify, or right_justify, default is center
  Specifies the alignment of text within a node. */
  
  /* title: "String", no default value
  Specifies the unique string identifying the node. This attribute is
  mandatory for the node specification. */

DEF_ATTR (title, "title", const char *, GDL_CODE_STR, "")

  /* useractioncmd3: "String", default is "" (empty string)
  As of aiSee 3.beta, enables a command to be specified that can be executed
  by clicking on the node in the User Actions Mode. */
  
  /* vertical_order: maxlevel or Int, default is -1 (i.e. no default)
  In a hierarchical layout, this attribute specifies the vertical position of
  a node. maxlevel tries to position the node at the maximum calculated level.
  Generally speaking, the vertical position of a node is called level or rank
  (see rank assignment), with the node attribute level being a synonym for the
  attribute vertical_order.
  
  All nodes of level 0 form the uppermost layer (if the graph orientation is
  top_to_bottom). Nodes of level 1 form the second layer, etc. The level
  specification is not in effect unless automatic layout is being calculated.
  Layout is calculated automatically if there is at least one node without a
  specified location (see loc attribute for nodes and loc attribute for
  summary nodes).
  
  The level specification may conflict with a near edge specification, because
  the source and target node of a near edge have to have the same level. In
  this case, the level specification of the source or the target node of the
  near edge is ignored. */

DEF_ATTR (vertical_order, "vertical_order", int, GDL_CODE_INT, -1)

  /* width: Int
  default is (node label width) pixels
  specifies the width of a node including the border. See also height. */

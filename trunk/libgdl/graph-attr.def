  /* amax: Int, default: calculated automatically
     Attribute of top-level graph

     of aiSee 2.1.89
     Attribute of top-level graph, subgraphs
     Specifies the mode for drawing edge arrow heads. fixed is useful if
     port_sharing is used because then only a fixed set of rotations for the
     arrow heads is used, the arrow head being rotated only in increments of 45
     degrees. In the free mode, each arrow head is rotated individually for
     each edge. If a node has many incoming edges and port_sharing is used, the
     free mode can lead to a somewhat confusing image. See example. */
     
     
  /* attraction: Int, default is 60
     Attribute of top-level graph
     Applies only to the forcedir layout algorithm, where it is part of the
     force-directed spring embedder during attractive impulse calculation. It
     specifies the constant proportional to the attractive forces acting on a
     node. This constant and its repulsive counterpart repulsion enable the
     length of edges to be controlled. For example, if only attractive and
     repulsive forces are working on a node, an edge length of n pixels is
     achieved for edges with priority of 1 by specifying n2 for the attributes
     attraction and repulsion. Usually the values for these two attributes are
     of the same order of magnitude. For details, see force-directed layout. */
     
  /* bmax: Int, default is 100
     Attribute of top-level graph, subgraphs
     Sets the maximum number of iterations of the phase reducing edge bends.
     Edge bends are used to prevent edges from being drawn across nodes.
     Reducing the number of iterations reduces layout calculation time, however
     the layout quality may suffer. */

     specification of the layout parameters for the forcedir layout algorithm
     it is possible for nodes to move far away from one another (especially
     single nodes or unconnected components). These two attributes enable a
     rectangle to be specified within which the graph is drawn, preventing
     nodes from being placed "infinitely" far from one another. For details,
     see force-directed layout. */

  /* cmax: Int, default is infinite
     cmin: Int, default is 0
     Attributes of top-level graph, subgraphs
     cmin sets the minimum number of iterations that are performed for reducing
     crossings using crossing weights. The normal method stops when two
     consecutive checks no longer cause the number of crossings to be reduced.
     However, this number of crossings might be a local minimum, meaning the
     number of crossing might decrease even more after some more iterations.
     cmax sets the maximum number of iterations of the crossing reduction
     phase. A reduction of this value causes the layout process to be speeded
     up. The default value is infinite meaning that the method is iterated as
     long as any improvement is possible. */

     of subgraphs respectively. This color is valid as the background color in
     summary nodes, boxes, clusters and as a wrapping color. For available

     Attribute of top-level graph, subgraphs
     Enables the default color map to be filled and changed. A color is a
     triple of integer values for the red, green and blue part (RGB). Each
     integer ranges from 0 (color part turned off) to 255 (color part turned

  /* crossing_optimization: yes or no, default is yes
     Attribute of top-level graph, subgraphs
     yes activates the crossing optimization phase, which works locally. It is
     a postprocessing phase after normal crossing reduction. It tries to
     optimize locally by exchanging pairs of nodes to reduce the number of
     crossings.
     
     Top
     
     crossing_phase2: yes or no, default is yes
     Attribute of top-level graph, subgraphs
     yes activates crossing reduction phase two. In this phase, nodes having
     equal crossing weights are permuted. Note that this is the most
     time-consuming phase of crossing reduction.
     
     Top
     
     crossing_weight: Weight, default is bary
     Attribute of top-level graph, subgraphs
     Specifies the weight to be used for crossing reduction. The following
     Weights are available:
     
         * bary
           The barycenter is used for calculating the weights during crossing
     reduction. This is the fastest method for graphs with nodes whose average
     degree is very large.
         * median
           The median center is used for calculating the weights during
     crossing reduction.
         * barymedian
           These weights are the combination of barycenter and mediancenter
     weights, with barycenter having priority and mediancenter only being used
     for nodes whose barycenter weights are equal.
         * medianbary
           These weights are the combination of barycenter and mediancenter
     weights, with the mediancenter having priority.
     
     There is no general recommendation as to which is the best method. A
     guideline might be to use bary if the degree of the nodes is large and
     median or one of the hybrid methods barymedian or medianbary if the degree
     is small, the degree of a node being the total of incoming and outgoing
     edges at a node. See crossing reduction for details.
     
     Top
     
     dirty_edge_labels: yes or no, default is no
     Attribute of top-level graph, subgraphs
     yes forces a fast layout of edge labels, which may result in overlapping
     of labels. Dirty edge labels cannot be used if splines are used for edge
     drawing.
     
     Top
     
     display_edge_labels: yes or no, default is no
     Attribute of top-level graph, subgraphs
     Enables/disables displaying edge labels.
     
     Top
     
     edges: yes or no, default is yes
     Attribute of top-level graph
     no suppresses the drawing of edges in the top-level graph and in all
     nested subgraphs.
     
     Top
     
     energetic: yes or no, default is no
     Attribute of top-level graph
     Applies only to the forcedir layout algorithm. Apart from the forces of
     the spring embedder and the magnetic fields, the local energy level of a
     node can be taken into account in deciding whether the node should move or
     not. Setting this attribute to yes causes the local energy present at a
     node to be considered during layout. For details, see force-directed
     layout.
     
     Top
     
     energetic attraction: Float, default is 70.0
     energetic repulsion: Float, default is 70.0
     energetic gravity: Float, default is 0.3
     energetic crossing: Float, default is 80.0
     energetic overlapping: Float, default is 80.0
     energetic border: Float, default is 70.0
     Attributes of top-level graph
     Apply only to the forcedir layout algorithm. Apart from the forces of the
     spring embedder and the magnetic fields, the local energy level of a node
     can be taken into account in deciding whether the node should move or not.
     The behavior of the local energy present at a node can be influenced via
     these attributes as follows:
     
         * energetic attraction is the weight of the attractive energy of edges
         * energetic repulsion is the weight of the repulsive energy between
         * nodes
         * energetic gravity is the weight of the gravitational energy of a
         * node
         * energetic crossing is the weight of the global energy of an edge
         * crossing
         * energetic overlapping is the weight of the global energy of a node
         * overlapping
         * energetic border is the weight of the border energy of a node
     
     Gauging layout quality can be done as follows: The better the layout, the
     lower the total of all the energy values mentioned above. For details, see
     force-directed layout.
     
     Top
     
     equal_y_dist: yes or no, default is no
     Attribute of top-level graph, subgraphs
     If this attribute is enabled (yes), then the vertical distance in a
     hierarchical layout is equal among all levels.
     
     Top
     
     fast_icons: yes or no, default is no
     Attribute of top-level graph
     yes causes icon file loading to be faster, which may negatively impact the
     quality of the drawing if not all the icon colors are present. For details
     on pictures in nodes, see icons.
     
     Top
     
     fdmax: Int, default is 300
     Attribute of top-level graph
     Applies only to the forcedir layout algorithm, where it is used in the
     simulated annealing part of the algorithm for specifying the upper hard
     limit for the number of iterations performed. The algorithm stops when the
     global temperature drops below a threshold value or when the limit
     specified here is reached. For details, see force-directed layout.
     
     Top
     
     finetuning: yes or no, default is yes
     Attribute of top-level graph, subgraphs
     no switches off the fine-tuning phase of the graph layout algorithm. The
     fine-tuning phase tries to give all edges the same length. It tries to
     improve the ranks of nodes in order to avoid very long edges (see
     assignment of ranks).
     
     Top
     
     focus, no value, no default value
     Attribute of subgraphs
     Sets the focus for the summary node of a subgraph, i.e. if the status of
     the subgraph is folded at startup, then the summary node of the subgraph
     for which focus was specified is centered in the graph window. The focus
     can also be specified for nodes. It goes without saying that the focus
     attribute should appear only once in a graph specification.
     
     Top
     
     fontname: "Font File",
     default is the default vector font drawn by turtle graphics routines
     Attribute of summary nodes,
     Attribute of subgraphs as of aiSee 2.1.96
     Specifies a pixel font different from the default vector font and used for
     drawing the text labels of summary nodes. This font is given by the name
     of the aiSee Font File containing the font description, e.g. a 12-point
     Helvetica Bold font can be specified via fontname: "helvB12". Note: If the
     font file is not in the current directory the environment variable
     AISEEFONTS has to be set to the directory containing the font description
     files. For the available Font Files, see additional fonts.
     
     Top
     
     fstraight_phase: yes or no, default is no
     Attribute of top-level graph
     yes forces straight edges that are not anchored at the same position on
     the border of the nodes. This is useful only if no port sharing is
     selected, because bends are avoided by correcting the port position.
     
     Top
     
     gravity: Float, default is 0.0625
     Attribute of top-level graph
     Applies only to the forcedir layout algorithm, where it is used for
     impulse calculation. Only using a simulation of a spring embedder would
     force unconnected components of a graph to move further and further apart
     from one another, as there would be no attractive forces acting between
     them. That is why gravity is introduced as a counterforce. gravity: Float
     specifies the constant which is proportional to the gravitational force
     acting on a node. This constant controls the strength of the gravitational
     force, e.g. a value of zero cancels out the influence of any gravitational
     force. For details, see force-directed layout.
     
     Top
     
     height: Int
     default for top-level graph is (height of root screen — 100) pixels,
     default for subgraphs is (height of the label for summary nodes) pixels
     Attribute of top-level graph, subgraphs
     In the top-level graph, this attribute specifies the height of the display
     window in pixels. For a subgraph, it specifies the height of the summary
     node. See also width.
     
     Top
     
     hidden: Int, no default value
     Attribute of top-level graph
     Specifies the edge class to be hidden. To hide more than one edge class,
     repeat this attribute for each additional edge class. Edges in such a
     class are ignored during layout calculation and are not drawn. Nodes that
     are only accessible (forward or backward) via edges of a hidden class are
     not drawn, either. However, nodes that are not accessible at all may be
     drawn (see ignore_singles).
     
     Note the difference between hiding edge classes and the edge line style
     invisible. Hidden edges do not exist in the layout. Edges with the
     invisible line style do exist, i.e. they influence the layout, meaning
     they need space and may produce crossings, for example.
     
     Top
     
     horizontal_order: Int, default is -1 (i.e. no default)
     Attribute of subgraphs
     In a hierarchical layout, this attribute specifies the horizontal position
     of the summary node within a level (see vertical_order). Nodes specified
     by horizontal positions are ordered according to these positions within
     levels. Nodes without this attribute are inserted into this ordering by
     the crossing reduction mechanism (see crossing reduction).
     
     Note: Connected components are handled separately during crossing
     reduction, thus it is not possible to intermix nodes of different
     connected components in one ordering sequence. For example, one connected
     component consists of nodes A, B, C and another of nodes D, E, all nodes
     being positioned at the same level. Then, for instance, it is not possible
     to specify the following horizontal order at level 0: A, D, C, E.
     Note further: If the algorithm for downward laid-out trees is used the
     specified horizontal order is retained only within nodes that are children
     of the same node, i.e. in case of downward laid-out trees it is not
     possible to specify a horizontal order for the entire level.
     
     Top
     
     iconcolors: Int, default is 32
     Attribute of top-level graph

     details on pictures in nodes, see icons.
     
     Top
     
     iconfile: "File",
     no default value
     Attribute of subgraphs
     Specifies the bitmap file (in PNG, PBM, PPM, or raw PPM format) to be
     displayed in the summary node of the folded subgraph. If the bitmap file
     to be displayed is not in the current directory the environment variable
     AISEEICONS can be set to the directory containing the bitmap file. For
     details, see icons.
     
     Top
     
     icons: yes or no, default is yes

     Top
     
     ignore_singles: yes or no, default is no
     Attribute of top-level graph, subgraphs
     yes hides all nodes of the graph which would appear singly and
     unconnected. These nodes have no edges at all and drawing them sometimes
     results in an ugly layout of the remaining graph. The default setting is
     to show all nodes.
     
     Top
     
     importance: Int, default is 0 (which actually means infinity)
     Attribute of subgraphs
     This is the central attribute when it comes to filtering in fish-eye views
     as it enables the importance of a summary node of a folded subgraph to be
     specified via an integer. Low integers signify less important nodes which
     are filtered out first by a filtering fish-eye view. High integer numbers
     signify nodes that are important, their being rarely filtered out. A value
     of 0 represents an infinite importance, the result being that these nodes
     are never filtered out. This attribute exists for nodes too, see
     importance. See also view.

     character), that influence the size of the node. See character set for
     more details. If no label is specified for a subgraph, the value of the
     title of the subgraph is used. */

     creates labels and then partitions the graph. The latter option yields a

     layout_algorithm: Algorithm, default is normal
     Attribute of top-level graph, subgraphs
     Specifies the basic layout Algorithm, there being two main categories. The
     first fourteen algorithms describe variations of a hierarchical layout,
     whereas the last algorithm implements a force-directed layout. The
     variations differ in the way nodes are selected for the various levels in
     the hierarchical layout.
     
         * normal
           Tries to give all edges the same orientation and is based on the
     calculation of strongly connected components. The algorithms based on
     depth first search are faster.
         * dfs
           Uses a depth first search for layout calculation, but does not
     enforce additional constraints pertaining to the degree of nodes. It is
     faster than the normal layout algorithm. The resulting layout is heavily
     dependent on the initial order of the nodes in the graph specification.
         * maxdepth / mindepth
           These two algorithms are based on depth first search and are both
     fast heuristics. maxdepth tries to increase the depth of the layout,
     mindepth tries to increase the width of the layout.
         * maxdepthslow / mindepthslow
           These slower algorithms might be better if the fast heuristics
     offered by the algorithms maxdepth and maxdepth do not provide satisfying
     results. maxdepthslow tries to increase the depth of the layout and
     mindepthslow the width of the layout.
         * maxindegree / minindegree
           Schedule nodes with a maximum/minimum of incoming edges first, i.e.
     these nodes are positioned early.
         * maxoutdegree / minoutdegree
           Schedule nodes with a maximum/minimum of outgoing edges first, i.e.
     these nodes are positioned early.
         * maxdegree / mindegree
           Schedule nodes with a maximum/minimum of the sum of incoming and
     outgoing edges first, i.e. these nodes are positioned early.
         * minbackward
           Instead of calculating strongly connected components, this algorithm
     performs a topological sorting to assign ranks to the nodes. It is fast if
     the graph is acyclic.
         * tree
           A specialized method for downward laid out trees, see rank
     assignment. It is very fast for trees and tree-like graphs and results in
     a balanced layout.
         * forcedir
           Computes a force-directed placement. It is a nonhierarchical layout
     method that works well for undirected graphs. Some features of
     hierarchical layout like near edges are disabled for this layout
     algorithm. The layout calculation for this algorithm can be controlled via
     the following graph attributes:
               o Spring embedder forces attraction, repulsion
               o Gravitational force gravity
               o Simulated annealing: fdmax, tempmin / tempmax, temptreshold,
     tempscheme, tempfactor
               o Random influence: randomfactor, randomrounds, randomimpulse
               o Magnetic forces: magnetic_field1 / 2, magnetic_force1 / 2
               o Energy level: energetic, energetic attraction / repulsion /
     gravity / crossing / overlapping / border
               o Boundary rectangle border x / y */

     A layout algorithm partitions the set of edges into edges pointing upward,

     edges is also called near edges. If the layout_downfactor is large as
     compared to the layout_upfactor and layout_nearfactor, then the positions

     by the edges pointing upwards.
     
     If the layout_nearfactor is large, then the positions of the nodes are
     mainly determined by the edges pointing sidewards.

     Attributes of top-level graph
     Apply only to the forcedir layout algorithm, where magnetic fields are
     part of impulse calculation. Forces that originate from a simulation of a
     spring embedder neglect the directions of edges. In directed graphs edges
     should point in a uniform direction, consequently magnetic forces are
     introduced, with edges being interpreted as magnetic needles that align
     according to the Orientation of a magnetic field. The following
     Orientations are available:
     
         * top_to_bottom
         * bottom_to_top
         * left_to_right

     Arrow Modes and Port SharingGenerally speaking, if multiple edges are
     adjacent to the same node, and the arrow heads of all these edges have the
     same appearance (color, size, etc.), these edges may share a port at a
     node. This means that only one arrow head is drawn, and all edges meet at
     this arrow head. This enables many edges to be located adjacent to one
     node without getting confused by too many arrow heads. If no port sharing
     is used, each edge gets its own port. See example. */

         * boxed
           The subgraph is surrounded by a frame, i.e. drawn in a box. The
     nodes inside the box are independent of the rest of the graph, i.e. there
     are no edges connecting nodes outside the box with nodes inside the box
     and vice versa. See also box operations.
         * clustered
           The subgraph is surrounded by a frame. In contrast to a box, edges
     from nodes outside the frame are drawn to nodes inside the frame and vice
     versa. This is an experimental feature. See also cluster operations.

     Attribute of top-level graph
     Enables one of the six fish-eye view Modes to be selected. If a graph is
     large only a small amount of it is visible in the graph window because of
     the fixed size of the window. Scaling the graph down so that it fits into
     the window causes details to no longer be recognizable. The solution to
     this is fish-eye views. A fish-eye view is a coordinate transformation,
     causing the view of the graph to be distorted. There is a focus which is
     magnified so that all the details can be seen. Parts of the graph that are
     far away from the focus are scaled down. The following fish-eye view Modes
     are available:
     
         * pfish
           Self-adaptable polar fish-eye view. The plane containing the graph

     this sphere.
         * cfish
           Self-adaptable Cartesian fish-eye view. The effect of the Cartesian
     fish eye is similar to polar fish-eye view, only that the Cartesian
     coordinate system is transformed instead of the polar system. In this view
     horizontal and vertical lines remain horizontal and vertical after
     transformation, i.e. they are not bent as in the case of polar fish-eye
     view.
         * fpfish
           Polar fish-eye view with a fixed radius. Here the fish-eye view only
     shows a fixed radius around the focus, meaning the entire graph may no
     longer be visible.
         * fcfish
           Cartesian fish-eye view with a fixed radius. Here the fish eye only
     shows a fixed radius around the focus, meaning the entire graph may no
     longer be visible.
         * dpfish
           Polar fish-eye view with a double focus.

     width: Int
     default for top-level graph is (width of root screen - 100) pixels,
     default for subgraphs is (width of the label for summary nodes) pixels
     Attribute of top-level graph, subgraphs
     In the top-level graph, this attribute specifies the width of the display
     window in pixels. In a subgraph specification, it specifies the width of
     the summary node in pixels. See also height.

     x: Int
     y: Int
     default for top-level graph is 0 for both,
     default for subgraphs is unspecified for both
     Attributes of top-level graph, subgraphs
     In the top-level graph, these attributes specify the position of the graph
     window in relation to the root screen, i.e. the x and y coordinates of the
     upper left corner of the graph window are specified in pixels. The origin
     of the root screen is in the upper left corner. In a subgraph
     specification, these attributes specify the x and y coordinates (in
     pixels) of the summary node in relation to the upper left corner of the
     graph window.
     
     The positions can also be specified via loc.

     xbase: Int, default is 5
     ybase: Int, default is 5
     Attributes of top-level graph, subgraphs
     In the top-level graph, these attributes specify the horizontal and
     vertical offset between the graph window and the upper left-hand corner of
     the graph, i.e. the position of the origin of the coordinate system in
     relation to the upper left-hand corner of the virtual window. In subgraph
     specifications, these are the offsets from the frame of the box containing
     the subgraph.
     
     When exporting the graph to SVG or PS, these attributes can be used to
     control horizontal and vertical offsets between the image border and the
     actual graph. Also, these attributes come in handy for working around the
     lack of image background color attribute in SVG. See example.

     Displayed Window and Virtual Windowxmax: Int, default is (width of the
     root screen - 90) pixels
     ymax: Int, default is (height of the root screen - 90) pixels
     Attributes of top-level graph
     Specify the maximum size of the virtual window used to display the graph
     (see picture). This is usually larger than the displayed part. The width
     and height of the displayed part cannot be larger than xmax and ymax. Only
     the parts of the graph inside the virtual window are drawn. The virtual
     window can be moved over the potentially infinite coordinate system by
     special positioning commands (see navigation).
     
     Note: It is advisable to set xmax and ymax so they do not exceed the size
     of the root screen so as to get good performance.

     xraster: Int, default is 1
     yraster: Int, default is 1
     Attributes of top-level graph, subgraphs
     In a hierarchical layout, these attributes specify raster distances for
     positioning nodes. The center of each node is aligned to this raster (grid
     layout).

     xlraster: Int, default is 1
     Attribute of top-level graph, subgraphs
     Specifies a horizontal raster distance for xlspace in pixels. The value of
     xlraster should be a divisor of the value of xraster.

     xlspace: Int,
     default is 1/2 * xspace pixels, if polygons are used for edge drawing
     default is 4/5 * yspace pixels, if splines are used for edge drawing
     Attribute of top-level graph, subgraphs
     Describes the horizontal distance between lines at the points where they
     cross levels. It is advisable to set xlspace to a larger value, if splines
     are used in order to prevent sharp bends.  */
